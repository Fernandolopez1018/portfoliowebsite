                    Hi, my name is Fernando, I've always been into computers! 
                    I built my first computer in middle school and have been a computer nerd ever since. 
                    I enjoy programming and want to make it my career from now on!
                    I currently live in Orlando and wish I could work remotely from here!
                </p>

                    <li>I am a great team player when I get to work in teams</li>

                <h2>About me!</h2>
            <p style="padding: 15px;">
                I love spending time learning about programming and design. I could spend hours learning about programming, 
                if things get hard, I take the time to solve new challenges and can learn from others as much as possible.
                Outside of programming, I spend time with my kids and watching sports. I used to play soccer but now I days I rather 
                watch sports and listen to music.
            </p>

            <!-- I added a style on p to add extra padding to the top of the second paragraph-->
            <p style="padding-top: 15px;">
                I am always looking forward to working with others and keep on learning new things that I could use later on in the future. 
                I am a team player and hope to have an awesome journey learning in thinkful.
